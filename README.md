# PHP Class Code Generator

## Overview

The PHP Class Code Generator is a web-based tool that allows you to automatically generate PHP code for class definitions from a provided input. Whether you're a developer looking to save time or a student learning PHP, this tool simplifies the process of creating class boilerplate code.

## How It Works

1. **Input Your Class Definition**: In the provided text area, input your class definition. Make sure to include the class name and any private attributes you want to include in your class.

2. **Click "Generate"**: After entering your class definition, click the "Generate" button.

3. **View Generated Code**: The tool will generate PHP code for your class, including the constructor, getter, and setter methods for each attribute.

4. **Copy the Code**: If you're satisfied with the generated code, click the "Copy Code" button to copy it to your clipboard for use in your PHP project.

## Example Input

Here's an example of the class definition input:

```php
class Example {
    private int $age;
    private string $name;
    private string $lastName;
    private string $address;
}
```

## Example Output

The tool will generate PHP code like this:

```php
class Example {
    private int $age;
    private string $name;
    private string $lastName;
    private string $address;

    public function __construct(int $age, string $name, string $lastName, string $address)
    {
        $this->age = $age;
        $this->name = $name;
        $this->lastName = $lastName;
        $this->address = $address;
    }

    public function getAge(): int
    {
        return $this->age;
    }

    // (Getter and setter methods for other attributes)
}
```
